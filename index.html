        <p class="info-me">Hi, there. My name is Dan. After spending a decade in higher education I finally decided to switch focus and become a programmer. This has been a long time coming. My early years of high school and college took the path of a programmer, but I made a decision to go a different route. While I am making the move back to programming, my experience in education and my degree in Communication have provided me with the soft skills often missing in the tech world. I am proficient not only in coding, but communicating my ideas and concepts due to my background in public speaking. </p>
